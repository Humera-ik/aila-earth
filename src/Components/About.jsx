      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Aila platform is a one-stop-shop powering small and medium-sized
        enterprises to take direct action to reduce their CO2 emissions.

        You might have heard the saying "there is no planet B", stating that the
        current consumption of natural resources and misuse of our earth is just
        not sustainable. Since the 1800s, the climate has warmed globally by
        approximately one degree and in Finland by about two degrees. The
        consequences of climate change include, among others, intense droughts,
        water scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar
        ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Warming will continue, but we can still limit the extent of it by the
        actions we now take, and companies play a critical role here. Companies
        produce just about everything we buy, use, and throw away and play an
        outsised role in driving global climate change.
      </p>
      <p>
        Luckily, there is a clear shift towards a stronger realisation that all
        companies, small or large, need to be part of the change towards a more
        sustainable future and combatting climate change. The pressure to build
        a more sustainable business and take concrete climate actions comes from
        the entire value chain, top-down and bottom-up:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Taxation & increasing regulation ( EU & local governments)</li>
        <li>Competitiveness & ability to be part of corporate value chains</li>
        <li>Employer image & branding</li>
        <li>Funding and investor relations</li>
        <li>Increasingly conscious consumers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Many large corporations are already on board setting net zero targets.
        However, SMEs, representing 90% of business worldwide and being the
        pillars of supply chains, also play a pivotal role in tackling climate
        change.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, they are left quite alone with the challenging task of
        making impactful changes to their business and operations. It takes time
        or money, usually both, to gather enough information and then research
        the best options forward. At Aila we noticed a clear absence here, the
        lack of a transparent, centralised and easily usable platform for SMEs
        to take direct climate action. That is where Aila now steps in.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are increasing number of sites and businesses already offering
        emission compensation services, which is an important part of combatting
        climate change. However, the focus should be first and foremost on
        companies reducing their own emissions. Only after that, what is
        currently not possible or reasonable to eliminate, company should look
        for the alternatives to offset and compensate. The challenge to reach
        net zero is huge, so practical action is a priority.
      </p>

      <ul>
